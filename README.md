Script to make GC Sensitivity Plot for ngVLA

Will make a plot of ngVLA sensitivity curves (assume 10 x VLA 
sensitivity) for three bands: 3, 10, and 15 GHz and for two 
scattering regimes: magnetar (~1 s at 1 GHz) and hyperstrong 
(~1000 s at 1 GHz).  Magnetar scattering line is dashed, hyperstrong 
is solid.

The script is pretty messy...
